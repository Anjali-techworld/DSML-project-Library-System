# DSML-project-Library Management System
In this project, we design and implement a comprehensive Library Management System, that efficiently tracks and manages library resources and activities. This system automates the management of book inventories, including details such as cost, availability status, and total number of books. By integrating multiple functionalities, the Library management System serves librarians, library staff, and patrons, ensuring streamlined operations and enhanced user experiences.
The Library Management System is built upon a robust database named library, structured with the following essential tables:
1.	Branch: This table stores information about various branches of the library, including their locations and contact details. here add 17 branches to the Branch table
2.	Employee: This table maintains records of library employees, their roles, contact information, and associated branches. in this system, each branch has two or more employees.
3.	Books: This table captures detailed information about each book in the library, such as title, author, genre, cost, and availability status. This software added 50 above book details.
4.	Customer: This table tracks information about library patrons, including personal details and membership status.
5.	IssueStatus: This table records the issuance of books to customers, including details of the book issued, the customer, and the issue date.
6.	ReturnStatus: This table logs the return of issued books, capturing information on the return date.
By maintaining these interconnected tables, the Library Management System ensures accurate tracking of books, facilitates efficient book borrowing and returning processes, and provides valuable insights for library management. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, accommodating future enhancements and integrations.
